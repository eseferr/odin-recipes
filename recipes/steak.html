    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak,
      butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade
      into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron. Flat iron
      steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which
      makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly,
      flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic,
          parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder
          together in a small bowl.
        </p>

          Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small
          saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow
          to cool. Then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear
          very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can
          and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak
          in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or
          to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer
          inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for
          medium rare.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes
          before serving.
