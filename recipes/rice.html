    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Here is my recipe for the perfect sushi rice. You can eat this alone or
      roll into your favorite sushi roll with ingredients of choice. I use
      strips of carrots, cucumbers and slices of avocado. You can adjust the
      amount of vinegar in this recipe to suit your taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

          Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water
          until the water runs clear.
        </p>

          Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small
          saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow
          to cool. Then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear
          very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.
